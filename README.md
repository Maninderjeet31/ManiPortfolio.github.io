# My Portfolio Website
My Portfolio website project created purely with HTML5, CSS3, flex box, grid, Bootstrap 5 framework and some justifying and aligning here and there.
Hope you all like it.
This is a purely desktop website, the responsive website will be uploaded soon. :)
Below are the screenshots of my website
